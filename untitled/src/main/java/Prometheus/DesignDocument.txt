---Systems---
    Character Creation based on D&D 3.5 system. This includes some but not ALL of the depth from the TTRPG. We will use
    Name, Ancestry, Age, Class, Stats, Skills(though a much smaller list), saves, AC, and of course, HP. Some of these
    depend on each other and some are mor placeholder than useful parameters, as defined below.
    *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
        Name- placeholder. Use in Conversations
        Ancestry - parent(stats/special abilities) Augments starting stats and bestows starting special abilities.
                    In later iterations, may have social interactions as well.
        Age- Placeholder. Later iterations may have use in social interactions
        Class- Parent(Skills/special abilities) Determines what skills will have a bonus and confers traits and abilities
                upon level up.
        Stats- Child(Ancestry/Rolled) Basic D&D 6 Stat array. Used in EVERYTHING
        SKills- Child(Class) Search, spot, listen, heal, etc.
        Saves- Child(Class/Stats)
        AC- Augmented by your armor and equipment.
        HP- Child(Class) Rolled each level up and size of die is determined by Class
